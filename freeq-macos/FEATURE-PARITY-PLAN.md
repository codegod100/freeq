## 2026-07-02 deep dive: AV world-class pass + parity re-audit

Four-way audit (macOS AV internals / web AV inventory / test coverage /
post-June parity drift) followed by an implementation pass. All Swift logic
landed test-first; 148 SwiftPM tests green (was 60), 91.9% line coverage on
the tested core (`scripts/coverage.sh`).

### Parity gaps found & closed
- ☑ **Passphrase channel E2EE (`/encrypt` `/decrypt`)** — the one real gap vs
  web (missed by the June audit). Pure-Swift `ChannelCrypto` (CryptoKit
  HKDF-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM) pinned to the Rust `e2ee.rs` ENC1 format with
  Rust-generated interop vectors; policy layer `ChannelE2eeState` (echo
  cache, per-channel keys, placeholder on missing key) 100% unit-covered.
  Wired: send/reply/edit encrypt, receive decrypt, keychain persistence,
  restore on join, lock badges (top bar, sidebar, per-message).
- ☑ Mic/camera device pickers (web had them; macOS had none).

### Audio (was: raw inputNode, no AEC, no devices, no metering)
- ☑ **Voice processing** — `setVoiceProcessingEnabled(true)` + AGC on the
  input node: Apple AEC/noise-suppression/auto-gain. Without it, speaker
  playback from the Rust audio device echoed straight back.
- ☑ Input device selection (CoreAudio UID, sticky, live-switchable);
  hotplug/default-change recovery via `AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange`
  (stale-converter silent-mic bug fixed).
- ☑ Level metering + speaking detection (`AudioLevelMeter`: RMS → dBFS →
  attack/release hysteresis, 100% tested) → meter bar in call controls,
  speaking ring on self tile, **"talking while muted" hint with Unmute**.
  (Web has none of this.)
- ☑ Mute now also stops pushing frames across the FFI (meter keeps running).
- ☑ Permission-denied and capture failures surface as user-facing errors
  with System Settings guidance (were silent `print`s).

### Video
- ☑ Camera 1280×720@≤30 (SDK encodes P720; old VGA capture was upscaled),
  camera picker incl. Continuity, unplug → default fallback.
- ☑ Inbound render path off the main thread (serial render queue) with a
  `CVPixelBufferPool` (was: per-frame alloc + memcpy on main per tile) and
  failed-layer flush recovery (was: tile froze forever).
- ☑ Expanded call view is a real adaptive grid (`CallGridLayout`, tested) —
  was a non-wrapping VStack. Self-view mirrored. Mute state on tiles.
- ☑ In-call keyboard shortcuts (Call menu): ⇧⌘M mute, ⇧⌘V camera, ⇧⌘S
  share, ⇧⌘E expand, ⇧⌘H leave.

### Screen share (was: first display only, 15 fps, points-not-pixels, hijacked the camera track)
- ☑ **Dedicated `/screen` MoQ broadcast** (SDK FFI: `set_screen_enabled` /
  `push_screen_frame` / `ScreenTrackStarted|Stopped|ScreenFrame` events),
  matching the web client's `{path}/screen` convention. Fixes: web screen
  shares used to reach macOS as a phantom participant literally named
  "screen"; macOS shares now land in web's spotlight row; **camera + screen
  run simultaneously**.
- ☑ Display *and window* source picker (ScreenCaptureKit), Retina-aware
  sizing via `ScreenShareConfig` (fit real pixels into 1920×1080, even
  dims, never upscale — tested), 30 fps.
- ☑ Remote screens render in a letterboxed spotlight row (`resizeAspect`,
  never cropped) above the participant grid.

### Testing / tooling
- ☑ `scripts/coverage.sh` — llvm-cov line coverage for the SwiftPM core
  (`--html` for a browsable report). New-code files are at 100%.
- ☑ 88 new tests: ChannelCrypto (18, incl. Rust interop vectors),
  ChannelE2eeState (14), AudioLevelMeter (13), MediaDeviceSelection (7),
  ScreenShareConfig (8), CallGridLayout (10), CoreModelTests (18 — closes
  ChannelState/ChatMessage/ServerConfig gaps).
- ☑ `project.yml` synced with the hand-edited pbxproj (usage strings, AV
  frameworks, FFI-freshness build phase, `embed: false` for the static
  xcframework) so `xcodegen generate` is safe again.
- Note: `swift test` needs the full Xcode toolchain
  (`DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`) — the
  CommandLineTools default lacks XCTest.

### Known follow-ups (not blockers)
- ☐ Remote **active-speaker** highlighting needs per-participant audio-level
  events from the Rust decoder (remote audio never crosses into Swift).
  FFI sketch: `AudioLevel(nick, f32)` at ~10 Hz from the playout path.
- ☐ Speaker/output device picker — playback lives in Rust (cpal); needs an
  FFI `set_output_device(uid)` + enumeration. (Web lacks this too.)
- ☐ Screen-share **system audio** (SCStream `.audio` output mixed into the
  mic track, or a second audio rendition). Web also lacks it.
- ☐ iOS uses the same FFI: port the `/screen` broadcast UI there.
- ☐ Live E2E verification of the new `/screen` path against the prod SFU +
  a web peer (unit/compile verified; needs an unlocked GUI session —
  `scripts/ui-sweep.sh`).
- ☐ AV reconnect with backoff after transport drops (call currently ends).
- ☐ Swift tests are still not run in repo CI (ci.yml is Rust+web only).

- ☑ Send screenshots to a design sub-agent for critique.
- ☑ Extract prioritized design issues for a modern, light, friendly, delightful direction.
- ☑ Commit critique-plan update.

### Sub-agent critique synthesis

The current macOS UI reads as an internal IRC tool in a dark Slack/Discord shell:
functional, but too heavy, too segmented, and too protocol-forward. The large
empty transcript area makes quiet channels feel unfinished; the sidebar, member
panel, profile panel, and composer each use their own hierarchy rather than one
coherent product language.

Target direction: a modern native macOS social client that is light, calm,
identity-rich, and quietly technical underneath. Default surfaces should use
light macOS materials, warm off-white canvases, soft separators, confident
typography, and a restrained accent. The product should feel like
identity-native chat, not "better IRC with debug details visible."

P0 design work:
- Redesign the main shell around a light native macOS visual system.
- Replace empty channel voids with a channel welcome/context state: topic, MOTD,
  members, pinned item, activity summary, and a start-message affordance.
- Rework the composer into one polished message bar with grouped tools.
- Replace `WHOIS` as a primary profile action with user-facing identity/profile
  language; keep raw protocol actions behind advanced disclosure.
- Turn the DM/member profile panel into a real identity card: banner, avatar,
  display name, handle, verification, bio, status, and Bluesky link first;
  DID/host/server details behind an identity inspector.
- Unify trust and presence language so shields, checks, dots, handles, and DIDs
  do not read as unrelated badges.

P1 design work:
- Improve sidebar row density, selected states, previews, unread/mention states,
  and scanability.
- Make the member panel lighter and less bolted on; reduce role-heading weight
  and show avatar/name/handle/status cleanly.
- Establish a smaller type scale with fewer weights.
- Simplify the top bar into a cleaner title/metadata/action area.
- Add subtle hover, send, profile, unread, and presence transitions.

P2 design work:
- Add tasteful personalization for channels/profiles.
- Support compact vs comfortable density.
- Build a proper identity inspector for technical protocol details.
- Revisit dark mode after the light hierarchy works.

## 2026-06-15 P0 visual refresh implementation

- ☑ Apply a light, warm native macOS visual system as the default.
- ☑ Add a real empty-channel welcome/context state.
- ☑ Rework the composer into a unified message surface.
- ☑ Improve sidebar and member panel hierarchy.
- ☑ Make DM profiles friendlier and move protocol details behind disclosure.
- ☑ Rebuild, screenshot, and commit the first visual refresh.

## 2026-06-15 empty-channel overlay regression

- ☑ Add model coverage for "visible messages" versus deleted/empty history.
- ☑ Move the welcome overlay behind the message list's visible-message rule.
- ☑ Rebuild, relaunch, screenshot, and commit the regression fix.

## 2026-06-15 macOS AV + screen sharing parity slice

- ☑ Mount the existing macOS call panel in the chat view.
- ☑ Add an obvious top-bar call button for channels.
- ☑ Add ScreenCaptureKit display capture and publish it through the native AV video pipeline.
- ☑ Add screen-share UI state, slash-command support, and focused tests where practical.
- ☑ Rebuild, relaunch, WindowServer-verify, and commit the AV/screenshare progress.

## 2026-06-15 macOS empty-message regression follow-up

- ☑ Unify message-row rendering and empty-state decisions behind `MessageVisibility`.
- ☑ Pass the selected `ChannelState` directly into `MessageListView` so row rendering observes the active buffer's message array.
- ☑ Add adversarial tests for deleted-only and mixed visible/deleted message lists.
- ☑ Move saved keychain credential reads off the main startup path so the app can render while restoring a session.
- ☑ Make startup keychain reads fail fast instead of blocking on authentication UI.
- ☑ Rebuild, relaunch, WindowServer-verify, and commit the regression follow-up.

## 2026-06-15 macOS launch keychain prompt fix

- ☑ Identify legacy macOS keychain ACL prompts as the cause of repeated launch password/Allow dialogs on rebuilt/dev-signed apps.
- ☑ Move credential storage to the data-protection keychain for normal save/load/delete paths.
- ☑ Stop delete-then-add credential writes so saves do not touch old legacy keychain ACL items.
- ☑ Add SwiftPM guard tests that keychain queries use data protection and noninteractive auth contexts.
- ☑ Rebuild, relaunch, verify no launch-time keychain prompt path remains, and commit.

## 2026-06-15 macOS channel history rendering regression

- ☑ Probe live IRC CHATHISTORY wire shape for a disposable channel.
- ☑ Preserve parent `batch=<chathistory-id>` when SDK assembles nested multiline history messages.
- ☑ Harden macOS batch routing so targetless delimiter batches cannot create empty buffers.
- ☑ Extract shared history-batch application logic used by `AppState`.
- ☑ Add Swift routing and visible-buffer hydration tests for target fallback, empty-batch rejection, and timestamp ordering.
- ☑ Run Swift/Rust tests, rebuild macOS, visually verify via per-window screenshot, and commit.

## 2026-06-16 macOS history still empty after source fix

- ☑ Reproduce `#alexandria` empty in the launched macOS app while raw IRC `CHATHISTORY LATEST #alexandria * 10` returns messages.
- ☑ Confirm Xcode was linking stale `freeq-macos/Libraries/libfreeq_sdk_ffi.a` from before the SDK batch-tag fix.
- ☑ Rebuild macOS Rust FFI artifacts, rebuild/relaunch app, and verify `#alexandria` renders.
- ☑ Add a guard that keeps the macOS app build from silently using stale FFI after SDK changes.
- ☑ Commit the artifact/build guard fix.

## 2026-06-16 macOS `#freeq` protected-channel history still empty

- ☑ Reproduce `#freeq` specifically with live wire logs: guest joins are rejected with numeric `477` (`This channel requires authentication — sign in to join`) while public channels return `CHATHISTORY`.
- ☑ Add failing regression tests for protected-channel join rejection visibility, stale optimistic auth state, and background WHOIS diagnostic leakage.
- ☑ Fix the client path so protected-channel failures become visible, stale auth cannot masquerade as signed-in, and background identity diagnostics cannot render as channel messages.
- ☑ Rebuild/relaunch and visually verify `#freeq` behavior.
- ☑ Commit the focused fix.

## 2026-06-16 launch latest macOS build

- ☑ Rebuild stale macOS Rust FFI artifact after latest HEAD changed SDK sources.
- ☑ Rebuild the macOS app from current HEAD.
- ☑ Launch the rebuilt app.
- ☑ Confirm the FFI rebuild produced no refreshed tracked artifacts.

## Method

Four feature inventories were assembled (macOS / iOS / web / TUI) and ground-truthed
against the actual source. macOS turned out to already cover most of the surface
(auth, channels, messaging, edit/delete/react/reply/threads, signing, CHATHISTORY,
pins, member list, profiles, away, DMs, file upload, **image lightbox, Bluesky
embeds, YouTube thumbnails**, link previews, avatars, bookmarks, quick switcher,
notifications, autocomplete, settings, onboarding, MOTD, reconnect, P2P).

The Explore agent under-reported macOS media support — lightbox/Bluesky/YouTube are
all present in `Views/Chat/MediaViews.swift`.

---

## Confirmed gaps (macOS vs. superset)

### 1. AV — voice/video calls  (HEADLINE; present in iOS + web, absent on macOS)
The macOS `FreeqSDK.xcframework` was built **without** the `av` cargo feature
(0 AV symbols vs iOS's 17).
- ☑ Rebuild macOS SDK with `--features av`, library-mode bindgen, xcframework
      (`freeq-macos/build-rust.sh`). 17 AV symbols now in bindings.
- ☑ AppState AV state (stored props) + `CallController.swift` (AppState ext +
      AvCallbackHandler) ported from iOS
- ☑ Mic capture (`CallMicCapture` — AVAudioEngine, no iOS AVAudioSession)
- ☑ Camera capture (`CallCameraCapture` — AVCaptureSession → BGRA frames)
- ☑ `CallView` UI: participant tiles, mute/camera/expand/hangup, video grid
      (NSViewRepresentable for preview + AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer remote tiles)
- ☑ Signaling TAGMSGs: `av-start` / `av-join` / `av-leave` / `av-state`
- ☑ Toolbar call button per channel; session discovery via REST `/sessions`
- ☑ project.yml: AV frameworks + camera/mic usage strings + entitlements

### 2. Inline video/audio playback + voice messages (web/iOS have it)
- ☑ Inline `VideoPlayer` (AVKit) for `.mp4/.webm/.mov`
- ☑ Inline audio player for `.m4a/.mp3/.ogg/.wav`
- ☑ Voice message rendering (🎤) with playback
- ☑ Voice message recording + on-device transcription

### 3. Slash-command parity (TUI is richest) — ☑ DONE
Added as typed commands + autocomplete + help:
- ☑ `/edit` `/delete` `/react` `/reply`
- ☑ `/pin` `/unpin` `/pins`
- ☑ `/ban` `/unban`
- ☑ `/list` `/names` `/who`
- ☑ `/search` `/find` (in-buffer)
- ☑ `/media` `/img` `/upload` `/crosspost`
- ☑ `/oper` `/reconnect`
- ☑ `/av start|join|leave|mute|camera`
- (`/encrypt` `/decrypt`: macOS uses DID-based E2EE, not TUI's passphrase model — n/a)

### 4. Smaller gaps — assessed
- ☑ Ban *commands* (`/ban` `/unban`) added. Read-only ban *list* UI is NOT
      buildable: the SDK's `FreeqEvent` exposes no ban-list case (367/368), so
      there's nothing to render. Would need an SDK event addition.
- ☑ Step-up auth: NOT needed on macOS. macOS uploads via the server's own
      `/api/v1/upload` (DID-based), not direct PDS blob upload, so the
      incremental-OAuth `blob_upload` scope dance iOS/web do doesn't apply.
- ☑ Channel join-gates / policy editor

### Already present on macOS (verified, not gaps)
Image lightbox, Bluesky embeds, YouTube thumbnails, link previews, drag-and-drop
upload, DID-based E2EE, P2P DMs, pins, in-buffer search, member list / profiles,
away-notify, bookmarks, quick switcher, notifications, autocomplete, MOTD,
onboarding, reconnect.

### Superset items intentionally NOT ported (platform-inappropriate / different arch)
- Live Activity / Dynamic Island, Apple Watch app, CallKit — iOS-only OS surfaces.
- Siri Intents / Spotlight — iOS integrations; out of scope for parity.
- Vi-mode line editing, `/net` stats popup, raw-debug toggle — TUI terminal UX.
- Passphrase channel E2EE (`/encrypt`) — macOS uses DID-based E2EE instead.
- Voice-message *recording* + on-device transcription — iOS stretch; deferred
      (playback of received voice messages IS now supported).

---

## Result
macOS builds clean via `xcodebuild`, codesigns, and launches without crashing.
All substantive cross-platform features of the iOS/web/TUI superset are now
present; remaining deltas are platform-specific OS integrations or use a
different (already-present) architecture on macOS.

## Bugs caught by the screenshot sweep (and fixed)
1. **AV-leave crash (critical, shared SDK — also hit iOS)**: `FreeqAv.leave()`
   dropped the MoQ/web-transport session from the FFI thread; its `Drop` needs a
   Tokio reactor → panic → Swift `try!` fatalError → app crash on `/av leave`.
   Fixed by dropping the session inside `RUNTIME.enter()` (+ a `Drop` backstop).
2. **Markdown shown literally**: `parseMessageText` styled `**bold**`/`*italic*`/
   `` `code` `` but never stripped the delimiters, only handled `*italic*` (not
   the `_italic_` the toolbar inserts), and ignored `~~strike~~`. Rewrote to parse
   inline markdown (strips delimiters; bold/italic/`_italic_`/code/strike/links)
   plus bare-URL detection. Now matches web/iOS.
3. **DebugBridge off-by-one** (test harness): counted the trailing empty line so
   no command ran. Fixed.

## Full visual verification (post-unlock, driven sweep + targeted tests)
Confirmed rendering/working from screenshots: connect (guest), channel sidebar &
navigation, browse-channels, quick switcher, messaging, **markdown formatting**,
`/me` actions, emoji reactions, reply, edit, delete, pin, in-buffer search,
inline audio player, image fail-state, member list, topic, detail panel, MOTD,
help, and the **voice/video call** (start → camera → SFU session+ticket →
**leave without crashing** → clean UI recovery). Note: guests can't post to gated
channels (server policy) — messaging verified in a guest-owned channel.

## Verification status
- **Build**: clean `xcodebuild` (0 warnings in new code), codesigns, launches.
- **Live UI (pre-lock screenshots)**: connected as guest; sidebar, channels,
  messages with avatars + emoji reactions, member list, MOTD, compose toolbar,
  per-channel call button all render correctly (`/tmp/freeq-shots/02,03`).
- **Logic unit-checks**: media URL extraction (image/video/audio/youtube/bsky,
  including no-cross-match) — 15/15 pass (standalone Swift harness).
- **Expired-token recovery**: confirmed the stored broker token returns 401
  (revoked); the new path clears it and routes to sign-in.
- **Blocked tonight**: the full driven screenshot sweep needs an UNLOCKED GUI
  session (a locked macOS session doesn't run the SwiftUI lifecycle or window
  server). Run `freeq-macos/scripts/ui-sweep.sh` once unlocked to capture the
  full per-feature sweep; a watcher auto-runs it on unlock.
- **Test affordance**: `FREEQ_TEST_NICK=<nick>` guest-connects on launch and
  starts the DebugBridge, which reads `/tmp/freeq-cmd` and routes each line
  through the real `AppState.submitInput`.

---

## Sequencing
- **A.** Kick off AV SDK build (background) — long pole.
- **B.** Pure-Swift media parity (video/audio/voice rendering).
- **C.** Slash-command parity.
- **D.** AV UI + capture + signaling (after SDK builds).
- **E.** Ban UI, policy, step-up auth.
- **F.** Build/compile verification with xcodebuild.

Each phase committed separately (attributed to Chad Fowler, no Claude co-author).

---

## Post-feedback audit (user reported: reactions broken, logo not used)
Bugs found & fixed (all verified via screenshots):
1. **Emoji reactions never appeared** — no optimistic update, and the server
   doesn't echo reaction TAGMSGs back to the sender. Fixed: optimistic +
   idempotent add, toggle-off via `+freeq.at/unreact`.
2. **No app icon** — project had no asset catalog; shipped the blank default.
   Added AppIcon.appiconset from freeq.png + wired it.
3. **Pinned-messages bar never showed** — `pinnedMessages` was read but never
   written. Wired `fetchPins` (REST) on join + after pin/unpin.
4. **ChatMessage.== compared only id** — reaction/edit/delete could be
   diff-skipped by SwiftUI. Compare mutable fields.
5. **/edit, /delete, ↑-edit-last targeted server action notices** (e.g.
   "pinned a message", attributed to self, no msgid) → MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND.
   Excluded `isAction` lines from `lastOwnMessage`.

Verified working: formatting, calls, avatars (real for DID users), reply
threading, /me, edit "(edited)", delete, quick switcher, browse channels,
bookmarks panel, member list, inline audio, MOTD, help.

Known minor limitations (not bugs): OG link previews depend on the server proxy
(rejects oversize pages); `/list` `/who` don't render numeric replies as text;
channel messages have no optimistic append (appear on echo); self-away isn't
prominently shown; guests can't post to gated channels (server policy).
