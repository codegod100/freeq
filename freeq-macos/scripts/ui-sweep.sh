# Automated UI screenshot sweep for the freeq macOS client.
#
# Requires an UNLOCKED, active GUI session (the SwiftUI view lifecycle and the
# window server only run when the session is unlocked). Launches the app as a
# guest via the FREEQ_TEST_NICK env hook + the file-driven DebugBridge, then
# drives every feature and screenshots each step into OUT.
#
# Usage: freeq-macos/scripts/ui-sweep.sh [nick]
