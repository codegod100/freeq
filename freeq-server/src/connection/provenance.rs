//! Provenance declaration verification.
//!
//! Today this only handles `FreeqBotDelegation/v1` certs. Other provenance
//! shapes (free-form JSON metadata) flow through unverified.
//!
//! The verifier matches the canonical form used by `freeq-bot-id` (see S3):
//! the cert is JCS-canonicalized with the `signature` field removed, then
//! the bytes are checked against an ed25519 signature using the creator's
//! registered MSGSIG public keys (looked up via `db.get_signing_key_set`).
//! A key its owner retired before the cert's own `created_at` is skipped: it
//! could not have signed a cert made after it was withdrawn.
//!
//! Verification is fully synchronous — no DID resolution, no network I/O,
//! no async — so it runs inside the IRC command handler without blocking.
