/**
 * AV call mesh: who subscribes to whom.
 *
 * A freeq AV call is a full mesh over the MoQ SFU. Every participant
 * publishes ONE broadcast (their mic + camera) under a path
 * `{sessionId}/{nick}~{instance}`; everyone else subscribes to it. The
 * server's session roster (`/api/v1/sessions/{id}`) is the same for all
 * pollers, so the ONLY per-client decision is "which roster entries are
 * *me*, and what broadcast path does each *other* entry publish under".
 *
 * Getting that decision wrong is exactly how a "network split" looks from
 * the outside: A hears B but C doesn't, because C wrongly dropped B's slot
 * from its subscribe set, or computed a path that doesn't match what B
 * actually publishes. This module is the single source of truth for both
 * halves — the publisher and every subscriber build their paths through
 * {@link broadcastName}, so the two can't drift — and {@link computeParticipantSlots}
 * is the one place "is this me?" is decided.

 * a client disown a real peer who happens to share its nick — one-way
 * deafness, i.e. a network split. So:
 *
 *   1. Instance first. The per-call instance suffix is a globally-unique
 *      per-device-call id, so an exact instance match is unambiguously us,
 *      and a different instance is unambiguously someone else (including our
 *      OWN other device, which we DO subscribe to).
 *   2. DID fallback for legacy/native rows with no instance: us iff the DID
 *      matches. Two different DIDs sharing a nick are different people.
 *   3. Only as a last resort — no instance and no DID anywhere — fall back
 *      to nick. Degenerate; such rows also collide at the publish path.
