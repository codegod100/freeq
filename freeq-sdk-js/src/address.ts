// DM addressing: one rule for referencing a direct-message peer.
//
// A DM peer can be named two ways — a nick ("bob") or a DID
// ("did:plc:bob"). To make a DID the load-bearing identity, the same rule
// is applied everywhere a DM references a peer — the wire target we send to
// AND the local buffer/thread key we file under:
//
//   DID when we know it, else the input unchanged.
//
// Because it is idempotent (DID in → same DID out) and maps a known nick to
// the same DID, "bob" and "did:plc:bob" collapse to one conversation instead
// of splitting into two. An unknown nick — a guest, or a remote user this
// client hasn't learned a DID for — passes through untouched, so nick
// addressing keeps working exactly as before.
//
// Channels are never routed through this (callers guard on `#`/`&` first).

/** A syntactic DID: `did:<method>:<id>`. No network, no `id` validation. */
