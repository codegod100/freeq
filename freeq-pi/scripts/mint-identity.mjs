/**
 * Mint this installation's freeq identity WITHOUT connecting.
 *
 * `FreeqBot.create()` normally does this on first connect, which is fine on a
 * laptop. When provisioning a machine, mint first so the owner can claim the
 * DID before the agent connects: the owner adds it as one of their agents,
 * in the freeq web app's Settings → Agents or with
 * `freeq-bot-id register --owner <handle> <did>`, and the server proves the
 * unsigned certificate from that record. Nothing of the owner's comes here.
 *
 * The older way: let the owner sign the cert elsewhere
 * (`sign-delegation.mjs`) and drop the signed cert back in place before
 * connecting.
 *
 * Run it ON the machine being provisioned, from the freeq-pi package dir:
 *
 *     node scripts/mint-identity.mjs --owner did:plc:… --project freeq
 *
 * Idempotent: an existing key is loaded, not replaced, and an existing SIGNED
 * cert is left alone. Prints JSON on stdout:
 *
 *     {"botName","did","seedPath","certPath","signed":false}
